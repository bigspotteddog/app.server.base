Date:   Fri Aug 17 18:17:15 2012 -0700

    See #153: Corrected an issue where the result list might be an array list.  Compensated for a changed query string that now has irrelevant cursors.  Made it execute the query again without the cursors.

    See #153: Performance is now better.  Went back to only a start and and end cursor, rather than one for each row returned.  Conversion to a string and back is expensive.
